# GraphQL/Apollo Test Todo app
### A simple To Do app to test the features of Apollo and GraphQL on top of Springboot.

##### This simple project was to test feasibility of utilizing GraphQL/Apollo vs REST/Redux for our next application.  It started out with the idea of transitioning to Recoil for global state, but realized Apollo can handle state well enough for this app.
